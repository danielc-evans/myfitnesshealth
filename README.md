 Execution Instructions: 

All files uploaded. Upon download all files can be run using Python 3.8.2 and PYQT5.

The program is executed through the controller.

Also attached is a zip folder with the code segregated into a Model-View-Controller structure. 

Note that in Python it is impossible to run the code this way hence why they are all in one directory for execution.
